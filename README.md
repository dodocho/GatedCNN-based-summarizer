# gatedCNN-based Summarizer
Tensorflow implementation of GatedCNN-based summarizer. The encoder is gated convolutional neural networks descriped in the paper, Language Modeling with Gated Convolutional Networks, and the decoder is recurrent neural networks with GRUs. Beam search is implemented to improve the quality of generated sentence.
